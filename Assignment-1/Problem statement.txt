Problem Statement: Analyzing Selections from a Committee of Members
Scenario:
A university is forming a new Research Advisory Committee consisting of faculty members. The university has 10 faculty members in total, out of which 6 are Mathematics Professors and 4 are Science Professors. The committee will be composed of 3 members, selected from this group. The selection process involves both combinations (for choosing the committee members) and conditions related to specific categories of faculty members.
Conditions:
1.	The committee must consist of at least 1 Mathematics Professor and at least 1 Science Professor.
2.	The order in which committee members are chosen does not matter.
3.	We must also consider the possible number of ways in which the committee could include only Mathematics Professors or only Science Professors, as well as those where both are represented.


Explanation of the Code:
1.	Combinations Calculation:
	The combinations function uses math.comb(n, k) to compute the number of ways to choose kkk items from nnn items.
2.	Total Committee Formation:
	We calculate the total number of ways to form a committee by selecting 3 members from 10 faculty members using combinations.
3.	Valid Committees (at least 1 Mathematics Professor and 1 Science Professor):
	We calculate the number of ways to form a committee with combinations of Mathematics Professors and Science Professors, ensuring that both categories are represented.
4.	Committees with Only Mathematics Professors:
	We calculate the number of ways to select 3 Mathematics Professors, ensuring that there are enough Mathematics Professors to choose from.
5.	Committees with Only Science Professors:
	Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to select 3 Science Professors.
6.	Set Theory:
	We define sets MMM and SSS for Mathematics and Science Professors, respectively.
	We calculate the union M∪SM \cup SM∪S, intersection M∩SM \cap SM∩S, and the complement of MMM (i.e., faculty who are not Mathematics Professors).
